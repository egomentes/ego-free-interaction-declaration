Ego-Free Interaction Declaration

This repository contains the open foundational text of the Ego-Free Interaction concept.
Ego-free interaction describes a communication mode in which understanding and learning are not distorted by identity defence, status competition, or ego-driven conflict.

The goal of this project is to make this principle publicly available as a shared civilizational idea that anyone may use, adapt, and further develop.
